# Watch List

Watch list is a web application that connects the user to real time information of what videos/movies are available to watch.  This web app also allows users to save videos/movies to their own watch list to keep track of things they like.

Some UIcomponents were built in React.JS, while the actual Poster items themselves are generated elements through the use of javascript/jquery.
